  abstract =	 {The inner structure of a material is called
                  microstructure. It stores the genesis of a material
                  and determines all its physical and chemical
                  properties.  While microstructural characterization
                  is widely spread and well known, the microstructural
                  classification is mostly done manually by human
                  experts, which opens doors for huge
                  uncertainties. Since the microstructure could be a
                  combination of different phases with complex
                  substructures its automatic classification is very
                  challenging and just a little work in this field has
                  been carried out. Prior related works apply mostly
                  designed and engineered features by experts and
                  classify microstructure separately from feature
                  extraction step. Recently Deep Learning methods have
                  shown surprisingly good performance in vision
                  applications by learning the features from data
                  together with the classification step. In this work,
                  we propose a deep learning method for microstructure
                  classification in the examples of certain
                  microstructural constituents of low carbon
                  steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise
                  segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks
                  (FCNN) accompanied by max-voting scheme. Our system
                  achieves 93.94 \% classification accuracy,
                  drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art
                  method of 48.89 \% accuracy, indicating the
                  effectiveness of pixel-wise approaches. Beyond the
                  success presented in this paper, this line of
                  research offers a more robust and first of all
                  objective way for the difficult task of steel
                  quality appreciation.},
